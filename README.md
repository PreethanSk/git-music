# Music Versioning System

A **version control system for music projects**, inspired by Git, designed to manage, collaborate, and track changes in music production seamlessly.

---

## Features

### Versioning System (Git-like)
- **Commit history:** Each commit is timestamped, hash-verified, and includes notes.
- **Branches:** Create branches for different versions or mixes of songs.
- **Merging:** Merge branches similar to `git merge`.

---

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
All version control operations such as commits, pushes, pulls, branching, and merging are performed through a dedicated Command Line Interface (CLI). This allows:

- Precise control over your projectâ€™s version history
- Automation and scripting capabilities for advanced workflows
- Seamless integration with local music software and tools via CLI commands

### Desktop App *(Coming Soon)*
- Visual interface for managing version control operations
- See whatâ€™s changed since last commit
- Push and pull updates with a single click
- Branch switching and commit log view

---

### Diffing
- Visualize changes between commits:
  - File additions or deletions
  - Tempo changes (e.g., from 120 BPM to 125 BPM)

---

### Commit History
- Detailed log of who changed what
- Shows commit notes and timestamps

---

### Collaboration
- Invite collaborators with roles:
  - **Owner**
  - **Editor**
  - **Viewer**

---

### Remote and Local Workflow
- **Web UI:** Manage projects from the browser
- **Local app (upcoming):** Automatically pull and push commits to local music software
- One-click commits directly from within supported music software

---

### Access Control
- Projects can be **private** or **public**
- Shareable links to specific versions or commits

---

### Rollback and Compare
- Restore any previous commit
- Compare two commits with:
  - Audio playback A/B comparison
  - File change summary
  - Metadata differences (tempo, length, etc.)

---

### Project Packaging
Projects are structured like Git repositories:

/projectName
â”œâ”€ /stems
â”œâ”€ /exports
â”œâ”€ /projectFile
â””â”€ /readme.txt


- Activity feed and timeline similar to GitHub

---

### DAW Integration *(Future Feature)*
- Plugins for popular DAWs (Ableton, FL Studio, Logic, etc.)
- Commit and pull directly from your DAW
- Switch branches from within the DAW

---

## Cross-Platform Collaboration
Supports seamless collaboration across different DAWs and software â€” collaborators using different tools can work together without any hiccups.

> ðŸŽ§ This system empowers music creators to manage versions, collaborate, and keep full control of their projects just like developers do with code.
