What it does

    versioning system just like git -> each commit is timestamped, hash-verified, contains notes
    -branches -> allow branches for different versions/mixes of the songs
    -merging  -> just like git merge

    diffing -> we can see whats changed with each commits (like file x added, tempo changed from 120 to 125 )

    commit history -> who changed what, what has changed, commit notes, timestamp

    collaboration -> invite others to the project, roles like owner, viewer, editor

    remote and local workflow -> web UI, upcoming local app to auto pull and push commits to local music software, one click commit from the music software itself

    Access control -> private and public projects, shareable links to specific verisons

    Rollback and compare -> restore any previous commits, compare 2 commits (audio playback A/B, file change summary, Metadata(tempo, length etc)

    Project packaging -> treat project like a git repo -> /projectName -/stems,/exports,/projectFile,/readme.txt
    -Activity feed and timeline -> git style feed
    -DAW integeration -> (later) create plugins for music softwares which allows commits or branch switching

this is cross platform and if two collaborators are using different software to run their projects they can still seamlessly collaborate without any hiccups.
