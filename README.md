# 🎵 MuseHub - Git for Music Producers

MuseHub is a Git-inspired **version control system for music producers**, built to manage, track, and collaborate on music projects with ease. It's designed for artists, audio engineers, and producers to keep full control over their creative workflow—just like how developers use Git.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔁 Git-Like Versioning
- Commit system: Each version of your music project is stored as a **commit**, with timestamp, message, and metadata.
- Branching: Create multiple branches for alternate versions, mixes, or ideas.
- Merge requests: Collaborators can request merges which must be reviewed and approved (based on role).
- Tagging: Tag specific commits (e.g., `v1.0`, `final_mix`, `live_version`).
- Diffing: Compare two commits to see:
  - Audio file changes (added/removed)
  - Metadata changes (e.g., BPM/key/length differences)

### 🧠 Project Structure
Each music project is structured like a repo:

/project-name
├── /stems
├── /exports
├── /projectFile
└── readme.txt


Supports audio previews (`.wav`, `.mp3`) and project files (Ableton, FL Studio, etc.).

### 🛠 Command Line Interface (CLI)

muse init
muse add drums_v2.wav
muse commit -m "Layered extra kick"
