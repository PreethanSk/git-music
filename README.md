# Music Versioning System

A **version control system for music projects**, inspired by Git, designed to manage, collaborate, and track changes in music production seamlessly.

---

## Features

### Versioning System (Git-like)
- **Commit history:** Each commit is timestamped, hash-verified, and includes notes.
- **Branches:** Create branches for different versions or mixes of songs.
- **Merging:** Merge branches similar to `git merge`.

### Diffing
- Visualize changes between commits, e.g.:
  - File additions or deletions
  - Tempo changes (e.g., from 120 BPM to 125 BPM)

### Commit History
- Detailed log of who changed what.
- Shows commit notes and timestamps.

### Collaboration
- Invite collaborators with roles:
  - Owner
  - Editor
  - Viewer

### Remote and Local Workflow
- **Web UI:** Manage projects from the browser.
- **Local app (upcoming):** Automatically pull and push commits to local music software.
- One-click commits directly from within supported music software.

### Access Control
- Projects can be **private** or **public**.
- Shareable links to specific versions or commits.

### Rollback and Compare
- Restore any previous commit.
- Compare two commits with:
  - Audio playback A/B comparison.
  - File change summary.
  - Metadata differences (tempo, length, etc.).

### Project Packaging
- Treat projects like Git repositories with structured folders:
/projectName
├─ /stems
├─ /exports
├─ /projectFile
└─ /readme.txt
- Activity feed and timeline similar to Git.

### DAW Integration (Future)
- Plugins for popular DAWs to allow:
- Committing changes directly.
- Switching branches inside the DAW.

## Cross-Platform Collaboration

Supports seamless collaboration across different DAWs and software — collaborators using different tools can work together without any hiccups.

*This system empowers music creators to manage versions, collaborate, and keep full control of their projects just like developers do with code.*
